# Black Bean and Mushroom Chili (for slow cooker)

Yields 10 cups

## Ingredients

* 1 pound dried black beans, (2 1/2 cups), rinsed
* 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
* 1/4 cup mustard seeds
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin seeds, or ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon cardamom seeds, or ground cardamom
* 2 medium onions, coarsely chopped
* 1 pound mushrooms, sliced
* 8 ounces tomatillos, (see Ingredient Note), husked, rinsed and coarsely chopped
* 1/4 cup water
* 5 1/2 cups mushroom broth, or vegetable broth
* 1 6-ounce can tomato paste
* 1-2 tablespoons minced canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, (see Ingredient Note)
* 1 1/4 cups grated Monterey Jack, or pepper Jack cheese
* 1/2 cup reduced-fat sour cream
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
* 2 limes, cut into wedges

## Preparation

1. Soak beans overnight in 2 quarts water. Drain the beans, discarding soaking liquid.
2. Combine oil, mustard seeds, chili powder, cumin and cardamom in a 5- to 6-quart Dutch oven. Place over high heat and stir until the spices sizzle, about 30 seconds. Add onions, mushrooms, tomatillos and water. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are juicy, 5 to 7 minutes. Uncover and stir often until the juices evaporate and the vegetables are lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Add broth, tomato paste and chipotles; mix well.
3. Place the beans in a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker. Pour the hot vegetable mixture over the beans. Turn heat to high. Put the lid on and cook until the beans are creamy, 5 to 8 hours.
4. Garnish each serving with cheese, a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.
